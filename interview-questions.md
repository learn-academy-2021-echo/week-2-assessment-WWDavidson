 # ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:

Methods are functions that are stored as object properties and perform actions on objects. For a method to work, it must be called by the name of the object it is located within. A function can be called directly by
it's name.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  The difference between a class and an object in javascript is that a class is dynamic, where as an object is static. That means a class is  more like a blueprint for objects, and objects are "hard-coded" with its keys and values.

  Researched answer:
Classes are used as templates for creating objects. Classes are dynamic so there are no actual values found in them. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class. Objects hold and store keys and values that can be accessed and manipulated.
